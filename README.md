Research Question:
How can predicting the Excess Readmission Ratio help hospitals identify areas for improvement to reduce patient overstays and unnecessary healthcare costs?

Application/Interest:
The goal of the model is to be able to optimize hospital resources which benefits both the hospital and its patients. By optimizing the hospital's resources, patients can be addressed not just earlier, but in a timely manner. From the hospital's perspective, optimizing their resources and being able to free their patient space efficiently, reduces overall cost and strain on resources. This is an important aspect that goes into hospital performance and evaluation that when taken into account, can give an institution a competitive advantage.

Conclusions:
The model appears to favor existing prediction/expected rate calcualtions, along with some favor towards the number of discharges. The recommendation is to evaluate how the prediction and expected rates are calculated for and identify the internal factors that influence them. This also means identifying the difference in calculation for both predicion and expected rates. After identifying these internal prediciton factors, they can be used in an even broader model similar to this one. For current application, setting benchmarks for these rates will allow for better preperation and prevention of potential excess readmission. 

Disclosure:
The modeling project utilizes sensitive hospital data, including patient readmission metrics. All data used in this analysis has been anonymized and compiled to meet relevant privacy laws and regulations for distribution. The predictions made by this model are intended to assist healthcare professionals in addressing excess patient readmission. However, it should be emphasizes that these predictions should not replace professional judgment. These insights should complement healthcare expertise, considering other factors that may not be captured by this specific model.

Generative AI was used to help frame the context of the dataset and assist in clarifying the logic behind the model created. While the AI provided suggestions and explanations, all final decisions regarding data processing, code creation, interpretation, and documentation were made independently. The AI was not used to generate code or to make conclusions on behalf of the project.
